And then you came crashing through another dimension to land on our planet... but it feels like you've been here before. No one ever sleeps on this planet - good! It will be a while before you accomplish the Mother's mission and return to sleep too: gather your will, tame the flow of time, and carry on the dreams of this planet's people! \"A Gal's dream will never die!\"",
